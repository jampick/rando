This repo may host multiple projects; for now it contains the Conan Exiles moonâ€‘driven server tuner (Wrath Manager). See:

- Overview: `MoonTime/wrath_manager/README.md`
- Event design (spoiler-light, operator-focused): `MoonTime/wrath_manager/EVENTS_DESIGN.md`

Wrath Manager adjusts Conan Exiles server settings based on the real-world lunar cycle and optional calendar events, with safe backups and a local test suite.
