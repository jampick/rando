This repo may host multiple projects; for now it contains the Conan Exiles moonâ€‘driven server tuner (MoonTide). See:

- MoonTide overview: `MoonTide/README.md`
- Event design (spoiler-light, operator-focused): `MoonTide/EVENTS_DESIGN.md`

The MoonTide tool adjusts Conan Exiles server settings based on the real-world lunar cycle and optional calendar events, with safe backups and a local test suite.
